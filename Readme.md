## About

Module for managing advanced content editing processes based on editor groups and asynchronous operations.

Do you want to quickly try out this project and see it in action? Check it out in our [Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions) full Orchard Core solution and also see our other useful Orchard Core-related open-source projects!

## Documentation

Apart from the main module ([Lombiq.ContentEditors](Lombiq.ContentEditors)) there are two other projects with their own NuGet packages:

- [Lombiq.ContentEditors.Samples](Lombiq.ContentEditors.Samples)
- [Lombiq.ContentEditors.Tests.UI](Lombiq.ContentEditors.Tests.UI)

Check out the [`Lombiq.ContentEditors.Samples` project](Lombiq.ContentEditors.Samples) for various examples in the form of an Orchard Core module.

Note: The _Lombiq.ContentEditors.sln_ file exists to provide centralized building of the independent projects but otherwise you don't need to use it.

### Features

#### Async Editor

The Async Editor feature provides an infrastructure for creating editors that can load and save content asynchronously. The editor can optionally render multiple pages where each page can load and save data independently.
